0.3:
-- Program overwrites seismograms by default. Add the "-o 0" flag to prevent overwritting, and write to "picked/" folder

0.2:
-- Program no longer crashes after an error is found in a seismogram. Writes problematic seismograms into a ``bad.log'' file within the ``picked/'' folder, with the name of files which encountered some error.
